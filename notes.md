## features

- just send data in JSON (whole or in chunks)
- mobile first
- UI options:
    - table -> scroll-x unavoidable
    - cards -> flexing unavoidable; can't have header.
- sorting & filter in frontend is fast. can be made more faster & unblocking using service workers (if users have problem with it).
- we don't need to support legacy browsers. People are watching youtube and netflix in browsers. Such browsers can certainly work with our website. If it not working in certain old browser and a user needs support for it, there are compilers to create code that works in it. We don't need to write legacy code.
- my code will work in all browsers released in 2017 or above.
